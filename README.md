# RCA_ADS2    -    Earth Engines

October 2025 
<br>


Earth Engines is a workshop that experiments with remote sensing as both method and medium, using Google Earth Engine to explore the atmospheric and spectral layers of the Earth. Through coding and cloud-based data processing, it reframes satellite imagery as temporal and moving surfaces to interpret and translate environmental change.

[Google Earth Engine requires all users to sign-up for an account](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register). This account is linked with Google Cloud and users must create a Google Cloud Project to use the service. 
- On the Product Registration Page, select Register a Noncommercial or Commercial Cloud project.
- Next, you need to choose How do you want to use Earth Engine?. Choose the Unpaid usage, click Next. Since we are in Academia provider, we have chosen Unpaid usage ‚Üí Research & Academia.
- In the next dialog, choose Create a new Google Cloud Project. Select No organization for Organization and enter a Project-ID. This id needs to be unique. A standard practice is to use the project-ID in the form of ee-<yourusername>. Click CONTINUE TO SUMMARY. If you have never used Google Cloud before, an error message will be displayed with a note You must accept the Cloud Terms of Service before a Cloud Project can be created.
- Choose your Country and review the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service and the terms of service of any applicable services and APIs. After reviewing, click AGREE AND CONTINUE.
- You will be presented with a summary in the Confirm your Cloud project information dialog. Review and click CONFIRM.
- The project will be registered and you will be redirected to the Code Editor. If you are not redirected automatically, visit the Earth Engine Code Editor.

## CODE SNIPPETS :globe_with_meridians: 

The following code snippets are designed as **interactive examples** to be used during the lecture. In the **second part of the workshop**, we will **break down and explain each section of the code**


### 00.Satellites

- **Pixels** ‚Äì Understanding how satellite images are composed of discrete units of information.  
- **Orbits and Frequency** ‚Äì Exploring how satellites capture imagery at different time intervals and resolutions.

### 01.Elevation 

- **Height** ‚Äì Map the vertical dimension of the Earth's surface.

### 02.Spectrum and Indexes

- **Light** ‚Äì When light strikes an object, it can be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected. How this interaction happens and how it depends on the material properties of the surface?  
- **Bands** ‚Äì Combining bands - specific segments of the electromagnetic spectrum.

### 03.Time Machine

- **Time** ‚Äì The continuous Landsat archive enables temporal analysis of Earth‚Äôs surface, providing multi-decadal observations for change detection.
- **Memory** ‚Äì  Each spectral band preserves radiometric information that allows reconstruction of past environmental and land surface conditions.

## INDEXES üõ∞Ô∏è 

Each of the following terms describes how energy interacts with Earth‚Äôs surface and atmosphere, and connects to three core satellites driving Earth sensing: Landsat, Sentinel, and GOES.
